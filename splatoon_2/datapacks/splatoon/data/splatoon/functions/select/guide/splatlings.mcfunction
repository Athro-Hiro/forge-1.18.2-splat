Splatlings usually have long range and a very high firerate. To start charging a shot, use the item once. To release a charge, use it again. When you release a charge, the weapon will fire automatically until its charge runs out. Releasing a charge prematurely will still allow you to fire, but at a sharply reduced range.\n"},{"text":"Heavy Splatling","color":"red"},{"text":"\nThe basic splatling.\n"},{"text":"Mini Splatling","color":"red"},{"text":"\nA short-ranged splatling that can charge up very quickly.\n"},{"text":"Hydra Splatling","color":"red"},{"text":"\nA very heavy type of splatling.
