By default, using weapons is done by right clicking. It is recommended to change this to a key on your keyboard or to use an autoclicker or turbo button, since this allows weapons like shooters to fire more quickly. Sprinting is not intended while playing this game.\n"},{"text":"Weapons","color":"red"},{"text":"\nEach main weapon comes with a predefined combination of sub and special weapons. There are three options available for every main weapon. Sub weapons are bombs and other utility items that require a lot of ink to use. Special weapons are very powerful weapons that do not require ink, but are only usable after you have survived for a predetermined amount of time.\n"},{"text":"Ink","color":"red"},{"text":"\nInk is required to fire your main weapon and to use your sub weapon. You can refill your ink by swimming in your ink. Your ink reserve can be seen above your hotbar.\n"},{"text":"Damage","color":"red"},{"text":"\nIn this game, damage is measured on a scoreboard instead of using regular Minecraft health.
