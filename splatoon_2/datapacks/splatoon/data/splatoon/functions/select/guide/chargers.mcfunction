Most chargers can kill in one shot at a full charge. Releasing a shot prematurely causes the weapon to shoot at very short range with low damage. To use a charger, use the item once to start charging, then use it again to release the shot. All chargers have a laser that is visible to everyone. Some chargers have a scope. These are instead charged by holding use item and shot by releasing use item. Most chargers can hold their charge while in squid form for a short time.\n"},{"text":"Splat Charger","color":"red"},{"text":"\nThe most basic charger. It has long range and requires a moderate amount of time to charge. The Splatterscope is a variant that comes with a scope.
